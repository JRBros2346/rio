We’re excited to share some great news with the Linux community — Rio Terminal is now officially available on Flathub via Flatpak!

For those unfamiliar, Rio is a fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator built in Rust. It offers a beautiful, minimal interface with modern features such as ligature support, true-color rendering, tabs, and a configuration-less setup experience — making it a top choice for developers and terminal power users who want performance without compromise.

## Why Flatpak?

Distributing Rio via Flatpak and Flathub means easier access and broader compatibility across Linux distributions. Whether you're running Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, or anything in between, you can now install Rio in seconds with:

```bash
flatpak install flathub com.rioterm.Rio
```

Flatpak ensures consistent sandboxing, updates, and dependency management, making Rio more accessible and reliable for a diverse range of users.

This milestone wouldn’t have been possible without the dedicated effort of [Ranieri Althoff](https://github.com/ranisalt), who generously contributed the Flatpak packaging and submission to Flathub. Ranieri's work ensures that more users can discover and enjoy Rio with minimal friction, and we’re incredibly grateful for the time and expertise he’s invested.

## Get Started with Rio

Ready to try it out? Head over to the [Flathub page](https://flathub.org/apps/com.rioterm.Rio), click “Install,” or run the Flatpak command in your terminal. For configuration tips, keyboard shortcuts, and advanced features, check out the [Rio GitHub repo](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio).

We’re thrilled to see Rio reaching more users and evolving as a next-gen terminal emulator for the Linux desktop.

Happy hacking!
